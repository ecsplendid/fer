# FER CPPN Explorer - Animation Documentation

## Overview
The FER CPPN Explorer is an interactive web application that demonstrates the differences between Unified Factored Representations (UFR) from Picbreeder and Fractured Entangled Representations (FER) from conventional SGD training. It provides real-time weight manipulation and smooth animation capabilities.

## Core Concepts

### Models
- **Picbreeder (UFR)**: Networks evolved through open-ended search with clean, semantic representations
- **SGD (FER)**: Networks trained via conventional stochastic gradient descent with entangled representations  
- **Available Models**: Apple, Skull, Butterfly

### Weight Parameters
Each model has specific "interesting" weights that control semantic aspects:
- **Apple**: Stem angle, apple size, background cleanup, etc.
- **Skull**: Eye winking, mouth opening, jaw width, etc.  
- **Butterfly**: Wing area, color, vertical shape, etc.

## Animation System

### Multi-Parameter Animation
âœ… **YES - You can animate multiple parameters simultaneously!**

**How it works:**
1. The system captures the COMPLETE state of all sliders when you set keyframes
2. During animation, it identifies parameters that have values in BOTH in/out keyframes
3. All qualifying parameters animate together with perfect synchronization

**Example Workflow:**
```
1. Move Slider A to 0.5, Slider B to -0.3, Slider C to 0.8
2. Press 'I' â†’ Captures: {A: 0.5, B: -0.3, C: 0.8}
3. Move Slider A to -0.2, Slider C to 0.1, leave B unchanged  
4. Press 'O' â†’ Captures: {A: -0.2, B: -0.3, C: 0.1}
5. Animation will interpolate:
   - Slider A: 0.5 â†’ -0.2 âœ“
   - Slider B: -0.3 â†’ -0.3 (no change, but still tracked)
   - Slider C: 0.8 â†’ 0.1 âœ“
```

### Smart Parameter Selection
- **Intelligent Filtering**: Only parameters with BOTH in AND out keyframes animate
- **Static Preservation**: Parameters without keyframes remain at current values
- **No Redundancy**: Avoids animating parameters that haven't changed

## Controls & Hotkeys

### Keyboard Controls
| Key | Function |
|-----|----------|
| `I` | Set IN point (animation start) |
| `O` | Set OUT point (animation end) |
| `Space` | Play/Stop animation |
| `Esc` | Exit fullscreen mode |

### Mouse Controls
- **Sliders**: Drag to adjust weight values in real-time
- **â›¶ Buttons**: Individual panel fullscreen
- **ðŸ”² Button**: Split-screen fullscreen
- **Model Buttons**: Switch between Apple/Skull/Butterfly

## Animation Settings

### Resolution Control
- **Range**: 128px â†’ 1500px  
- **Impact**: Affects both preview and animation generation
- **High-Res**: Use 1500px for presentation-quality output
- **Performance**: Higher resolution = slower generation

### Duration Control  
- **Range**: 1.0s â†’ 8.0s
- **Impact**: Controls animation playback speed
- **Recommendation**: 3-4s for optimal viewing

### Frame Count
- **Range**: 30 â†’ 120 frames
- **Quality vs Speed**: More frames = smoother but slower generation
- **Recommendation**: 60 frames for standard use, 120 for presentations

### Easing Functions
| Easing Type | Description | Best For |
|-------------|-------------|----------|
| **Ease In-Out Cubic** | Smooth S-curve (default) | Natural motion |
| **Ease In-Out Quad** | Gentler acceleration | Subtle animations |
| **Ease In-Out Quart** | More dramatic curve | Expressive movements |
| **Ease In Cubic** | Slow start, fast finish | Building tension |
| **Ease Out Cubic** | Fast start, slow finish | Settling effects |
| **Linear** | Constant speed | Mechanical motion |

## Fullscreen Modes

### Individual Fullscreen (â›¶)
- Click â›¶ on any panel for single-image fullscreen
- Perfect for detailed analysis of one representation
- Works during animation (shows live canvas)

### Split Fullscreen (ðŸ”²)  
- Side-by-side comparison in fullscreen
- Ideal for presentations and direct comparison
- Shows both UFR and FER simultaneously
- Animation-aware with live updates

### Fullscreen Features
- **High Resolution**: Scales to full screen quality
- **Live Animation**: Real-time updates during playback
- **Quick Exit**: Press Esc to return to normal view

## Animation Workflow

### Basic Animation
1. **Load Model**: Choose Apple, Skull, or Butterfly
2. **Adjust Settings**: Set resolution, duration, frame count, easing
3. **Position Sliders**: Move parameters to starting positions
4. **Set IN Point**: Press `I` to capture start state
5. **Reposition Sliders**: Move parameters to ending positions  
6. **Set OUT Point**: Press `O` to capture end state
7. **Generate**: Click "Play Animation" (will generate frames first)
8. **Enjoy**: Smooth animation with your custom easing

### Advanced Multi-Parameter Animation
1. **Complex Choreography**: 
   ```
   Frame 1: Apple size=0.2, Stem angle=0.8, Background=0.0
   Press 'I'
   Frame 2: Apple size=0.9, Stem angle=-0.5, Background=1.0  
   Press 'O'
   Result: All three parameters animate simultaneously
   ```

2. **Selective Animation**:
   ```
   Only move 2 out of 5 sliders between keyframes
   Only those 2 will animate, others stay static
   ```

### Performance Optimization
- **Cache System**: Frames are pre-generated and cached
- **Smart Regeneration**: Cache clears when settings change
- **Progress Tracking**: Visual progress during generation
- **Memory Management**: Efficient image storage and playback

## Technical Details

### Frame Generation
- **Process**: Pre-generates all frames before playback
- **Interpolation**: Uses mathematical easing functions
- **Quality**: No real-time lag during animation
- **Storage**: Cached as Image objects for instant playback

### Canvas Rendering
- **Technology**: HTML5 Canvas for smooth rendering
- **Performance**: 60fps capable playback
- **Scaling**: Automatic resolution handling
- **Memory**: Efficient pixel-level operations

### API Integration
- **Backend**: FastAPI server with JAX/Flax CPPN models
- **Requests**: Batched generation for efficiency  
- **Format**: Base64-encoded PNG images
- **Validation**: Comprehensive error checking and recovery

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues
- **Port 8000 in use**: Kill existing process or restart server
- **Slow generation**: Reduce resolution or frame count
- **Memory issues**: Lower resolution for longer animations
- **Animation stuttering**: Ensure frames are fully generated first

### Best Practices
- **Start Small**: Begin with 256px resolution for testing
- **Build Up**: Increase settings gradually for final output
- **Plan Keyframes**: Think about start/end positions before setting
- **Use Fullscreen**: For presentations and detailed analysis
- **Save Settings**: Note your preferred configurations
